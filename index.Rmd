# Overview {-}

This textbook approaches statistical analysis through the General Linear Model, taking a simulation-based approach in the R software environment. The overarching goal is to teach students how to translate a description of the design of a study into a linear model to analyze data from that study. The focus is on the skills needed to analyze data from psychology experiments.

The following topics are covered:

* linear modeling workflow;
* variance-covariance matrices;
* multiple regression;
* interactions (continuous-by-categorical; categorical-by-categorical);
* linear mixed-effects regression;
* generalized linear mixed-effects regression.

The material in this course forms the basis for a one-semester course for third-year undergradautes taught by [Dale Barr]() at the [University of Glasgow School of Psychology](). It is part of the [PsyTeachR series of course materials](https://psyteachr.github.io) developed by University of Glasgow Psychology staff. 

Unlike other textbooks you may have encountered, this is an **interactive textbook**. Each chapter contains embedded exercises as well as web applications to help students better understand the content. The interactive content will only work if you access this material through a web browser. Printing out the material is not recommended. If you want to access the textbook without an internet connection or have a local version to keep in case this site changes or moves, you can [download a version for offline use](offline-textbook.zip). Just extract the files from the ZIP archive, locate the file `index.html` in the `docs` directory, and open this file using a web browser.
